##definition
CNN:convolution neural network
##concepts
1.COVNETS:convolution neural network.It share parameter cross space.</br>
COVNETS is used to deal images.Usaully,image is formated as tensor:</br>
**[height,width,channel]**</br>
Where channel is the base color number of image,such as 3(Three primary colors) or 1(gray image).</br>

2.patch:the once input data slide size.It also is called kernel.</br>
3.depth:the once input data depth.And depth also mean the numbers of feature of input,so layers in depth is called feature map.
And most import is **input_size=patch\*depth**.</br>
4.padding: **VALID** keep conv inner image boundary.**SAME** keep conv output same as input.

##Optimization Strategy
1.pooling</br>
2.1*1 conv</br>
3.Inception</br>

##component
###convolution

$(f*g)(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty(f(\tau)g(x-\tau))d\tau$

There is some gif to show 1-D & 2-D convoluation

From the these expresssion,we can know that convolution compute the means with weight(convolution core).</br>
Convolution is used to catch feature from data.</br>
###pooling
There are usually two methods to pooling features :Max & Mean.</br>
There is a gif to show how pooling work:</br>

We can know pooling sclar down feature tensor by Max or Mean.We can reduce feature complexity by pooling to reduce computing.</br>
